# Study of Rubicks Cubes

### Content
The aim is to study the solving, undoing and permutations of different Rubicks Cubes. Just freak stuff.

### Roadmap
This project started many years ago. It is documented in Spanish. I should improve its code style and replace .py scripts with Jupyter Notebooks. I'm working to fix that. Please, don't judge me.
